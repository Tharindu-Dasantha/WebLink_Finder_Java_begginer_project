# WebLink_Finder_Java_begginer_project

 In this project we create a app that read web links from a file or a list of text.

## Description

In this project we go to the url `http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/data/manylinks.html` and read the file word by word.  
For each word if we see `youtube.com` in it, find the double quote to the right and to the left.
